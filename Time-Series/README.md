#Time-Series

This repository contains a demonstration of a time series tool developed in python. The tool is demonstrated using the Jupyter UI, and the accompanying code is what is running in Jupyter.

The tool was developed to allow users to focus on interpreting results and removing some of the backend development work and error handling. This code will allow users to plot input data and run diagnostics pertinent to time series analysis, compare goodness of fit results and ultimately fit models such as: Naive, Simple Average, Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing Models, and the Seasonal ARIMA model. 

The tool also incorporates some custom error handling such as data type mismatches and incorrect date ranges. An additional feature is the ability to normalize monetary data if necessary.
